# ShriaCLI
I created a cli thing for myself, conside me the OS. I made this as a time killer ; I've been working with automating running commands on all different kinds of CLIs of OSes you probably haven't even heard of (eg, ExtremeOS is a thing) so i decided I'm gonna have a cli too. 

Future idea : Ill make the whole thing open in a GUI window so its an ironic meta sort of thing
